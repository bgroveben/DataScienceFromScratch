    "1. Our goal is a function that takes a `from_user` and finds *all* shortest paths to every other user.\n",
    "2. We'll represent a path as a `list` of user IDs. Since every path starts at `from_user`, we won't include her ID in the list. This means that the length of the list representing the path will be the length of the path itself.\n",
    "3. We'll maintain a dictionary `shortest_paths_to` where the keys are user IDs and the values are lists of paths that end at the user with the specified ID. If there is a unique shortest path, the list will just contain that one path. If there are multiple shortest paths, the list will contain all of them.\n",
    "4. We'll also maintain a [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) `frontier` that contains the users we want to explore in the order we want to explore them. (A queue is a data structure that is optimized for operations that \"add to the end\" and \"remove from the front\". In Python, they are implemented as [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque) which is actually a double-ended queue.) We'll store them as pairs (`prev_user, user`) so that we know how we got to each one. We initialize the queue with all of the neighbors of `from_user`.\n",
    "5. As we explore the graph, whenever we find new neighbors that we don't already know the shortest paths to, we add them to the end of the queue to explore later, with the current user as `prev_user`.\n",
    "6. When we take a user off of the queue, and we've never encountered that user before, we've definitely found one or more shortest paths to him -- each of the shortest paths to `prev_user` with one extra step added.\n",
    "7. When we take a user off of the queue and we *have* encountered that user before, then either we've found another shortest path (in which case we should add it) or we've found a longer path (in which case we shouldn't).\n",
    "8. When no more users are left on the queue, we've explored the whole graph (or, at least. the parts of it that are reachable from the starting user) and we're done."
