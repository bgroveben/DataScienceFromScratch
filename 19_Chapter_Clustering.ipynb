    "Whenever you look at some sort of data, it's likely that the data will somehow form [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).  \n",
    "A data set showing where millionaires live probably has clusters in places like San Francisco, Beverly Hills, and Manhattan.  \n",
    "A data set showing how many hours people work each week probably has a cluster around 40.  \n",
    "Unlike some of the problems that this book has examined, there is generally no 'correct' clustering.  \n",
    "An alternative clustering scheme might group \"bored retirees\" with \"avid golfers\" and others with \"RV owners\".  \n",
    "Neither scheme is necessarily more correct -- instead, each is likely more optimal with respect to it own \"how good are the clusters?\" metric.  \n",
    "Furthermore, clusters won't label themselves.  \n",
    "You will have to do that by looking at the data underlying each one."
