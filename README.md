## Data Science From Scratch  

### Working my way through the book whose copyright information goes like this:  

## Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus (O’Reilly)
### Copyright 2015 Joel Grus, 978-1-4919-0142-7”  

### One source that has proven useful for quick reference is [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3] (http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html).

### Confused? Running the code through the visualizer at [pythontutor.com] (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) helps (sometimes, anyway).

The code is written in Python 3.4.3, for now at least.
