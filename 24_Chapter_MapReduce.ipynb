    "Our original (non-MapReduce) approach requires the machine doing the processing to have access to every document.  \n",
    "This means that the documents all need to either live on that macine or else be transferred to it during processing.  \n",
    "More important, it means that the machine can only process one document at a time.  \n",
    "Granted, you can write code to use multiple processors, multiple cores on the processor, and so on, but the documents still have to get to that machine.  \n",
    "Now, imagine that our billions of documents are scattered across 100 machines.  \n",
    "With the right infrastructure (and glossing over some of the details), we can do the following:  \n",
    "- Have the machine run the mapper on its documents, producing lots of (key, value) pairs.\n",
    "- Distribute those (key, value) pairs to a number of \"reducing\" machines, making sure that the pairs corresponding to any given key all end up on the same machine.\n",
