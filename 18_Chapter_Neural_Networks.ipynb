    "An [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), also known as an [ANN](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol4/cs11/report.html) is a predictive model motivated by the way (some scientists and scholars believe) the brain operates (in theory, anyway).  \n",
    "Think of the brain as a collection of neurons wired together.  \n",
    "Each neuron looks at the outputs of the other neurons that feed into it, does a calculation, and then either fires (if the calculation exceeds some threshold) or doesn't fire (if the threshold is not reached).  \n",
    "ANNs consist of artificial neurons which perform similar calculations over their inputs.  \n",
    "Neural networks can be used to solve a wide variety of problems including handwriting recognition and face identification, and are also widely used in [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning).  \n",
    "Most neural networks are \"black boxes\", meaning that inspecting their details doesn't give you much understanding of *how* they are solving a problem.  \n",
    "Large ANNs can also be (very) difficult to train.  \n",
    "Keeping those caveats in mind, artificial neural networks can be used to do some [amazing stuff](https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-incredible-day-dreams-of-artificial-neura-1712226908), so let's dive in."
